It is far from perfect but has its own merits. In particular, it struggles to find ramps in large palettes, but tends to work well with medium-sized palettes generated via linear RGB interpolation.

## Installation & Usage
- Download a zip file of this repository.
- Open Aseprite and head into **Settings/Preferences > Extensions**.
- Click on **Add Extension** and load the zip file.
- If previously configured, make sure **Sprite > Color Mode** is set to **RGB Color**.
- Under the Options panel, the **Sort By Color Ramp** option should now appear.
- Configure settings as desired and click on Sort.

## Algorithms & Design

### Assumptions
It is first important to note that, while there are no precise criteria for color ramps, methods such as linear RGB interpolation and hue-shifting are widely practiced and often considered when making ramps. 

However, the RGB color space is easier to work with than HSV. This is because RGB values can be translated directly as Cartesian coordinates, whereas HSV values are still of the cylindrical polar form. And so, only color ramps generated by linear RGB interpolation are considered.

There is also the problem that two color ramps can intersect. To simplify the clustering algorithm, ramps are assumed to be disjoint. This is a big assumption, but one that can be addressed for further extensions.

### How it Works
The entire process can be split into three parts: measuring collinearity of colors by 2D Hough Transforms, grouping colors into disjoint ramps by hierarchical clustering, and finally sorting the ramps internally and externally.

In the RGB color space, any set of collinear points define a color ramp. Now, the problem reduces to line detection. First, the points are projected onto the y=0 and z=0 planes, and both are parameterized onto a discrete Hough space. This accumulator space is then traversed through a window whose dimensions relate to the degree of how nearly collinear points must be. This is because palettes may not always contain precise ramps (i.e. no collinear points). The number of times two colors are contained in the same window is recorded onto a matrix, and this measure will be known as their "similarity".

We call a tree "skewed-full" if every node except the leaves has exactly two children and at least one of them is a leaf. A dendrogram is constructed out of the similarity matrix by the average linkage method. It is then cut at certain points when a branch is skewed-full and the minimum ramp length is met. Outliers, colors that do not fit in a ramp, are also recorded and are considered either individually or together as a ramp.

The colors in each ramp are sorted, and then the ramps are sorted. These are based on the sorting configurations set in the dialog box. Finally, the colors are added to the active palette.


### Design Liberties
The Hough space is discrete and, oftentimes, there are not enough cells to indicate that two lines do intersect. There are a few ways to deal with this:
- Increase the granularity (cell density) of the accumulator space.
- Traverse the accumulator space in a larger window.
- Thicken the line width when drawn on the accumulator space.

I chose to add support for the first option as it was quite easy to integrate. Although, justification for the other two methods can definitely be made. The window dimension was set to 3 by default as it felt to me as the minimum size that could reliably tell the collinearity of points without falling prey to the problem mentioned above.

Another vague design choice was the way to combine the number of times colors are incident on a window. As two transforms are performed, there will be two counts for this measure. Currently, it adds the two counts together and records them directly to the matrix. I initially felt there should be considerable weight in ensuring both counts are positive, as points appearing to be collinear in one dimension but not in the other can be misleadingly considered. But, upon testing with variants of the geometric mean, the matrix became sparse enough that clusterings could not be made - an overall lack of sensitivity. Another reason to favor a simple sum is that while colors aren't necessarily collinear in 3D space, appearing to be collinear in one projection seems to translate well visually.

Another is the use of hierarchical clustering and the choice of where to cut the dendrogram. The ability to arbitrarily define a distance metric (their similarity) made this clustering algorithm more convenient. Not to mention, no set number of clusters have to be made in advance. As for cutting it, configurable options in the dialog were added but is likely not enough to consider all ways in which branches can be pruned. The arbitrary "skewed-full" definition comes from my observations while going through some test cases. When trees are skewed-full, the leaves tend to be similar enough to be put in a ramp. It also avoids having too many outlier points (not belonging to a ramp).

### Further Extensions
1. Instead of projecting points onto 2D space and performing a Hough Transform twice, perhaps making use of a 3D Hough Transform parameterization (i.e. line detection for 3D point clouds) could yield a better sensitivity for the similarity measures.
2. A configurable option for allowing intersections can be added. This could be done through an overlapping clustering algorithm such as fuzzy k-means clustering, where k can also be configured from the dialog (i.e. number of ramps).
3. The sorting logic can be extracted to C to speed up the process.

## Reflection
For a long while, I've been looking for ways to make color palettes appear more visually digestible. This is the case as working with large palettes has often been overwhelming for me. Color ramps are perhaps the most intuitive in terms of understanding which colors work together the best. As most palettes are often created with color ramps in mind, it was only natural to fantasize about a magical sorting algorithm. Although, as best explained [here](https://www.alanzucconi.com/2015/09/30/colour-sorting/), there simply is no perfect way to sort a palette.

While this extension offers some form of help, I still think a two-dimensional representation for palettes, whether by [tiles](https://tgstation13.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=7444&start=50) or [graphs](http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2016-05-27-mapping/), is the best way to visualize colors.
